# p410.yml


This playbook is intended for a clean proxmox install on a server with a P410 installation. 

###Note:!!

###The server must have it's boot drive *outside* of the controller. Failure to boot from USB or with an adapter from the DVD slot will result in an unbootable system.

Simply run the playbook like this:

```
ansible-playbook p410.yml
```

After completion, the playbook displays lsblk to show that the individual drives are under direct control of the OS.
